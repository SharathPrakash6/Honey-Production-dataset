Data Visualization on Honey Production dataset using seaborn
 and matplotlib libraries.<br />
  Context:<br />
 In 2006, a global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component
 to American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to “Colony-Collapse-Disorder”, a
 phenomenon of disappearing “worker-bees” causing the remaining “hive-colony” to collapse. Speculation
 around the cause of this disorder points to hive-diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no
 overall consensus has been reached. Twelve years later, some industries are observing recovery but the
 American honey industry is still largely struggling. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it
 consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey
 consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and
 demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012<br />
 Objective:<br />
 The Goal is to use Python visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib to investigate the data and get
 some useful conclusions.<br />
 tools: python <br />
 result:<br />
The pie chart shows that the data is relatively evenly distributed across the years, with each year contributing a similar percentage to the overall dataset. Notably, the years 2002, 2003, and 2012 have the highest representation, each accounting for 7.0% of the total data. In contrast, years like 1999, 2000, and 2011 have a slightly lower representation, ranging between 6.4% and 6.9%. This even distribution indicates that the dataset provides a consistent view of trends over time, without any significant bias towards any particular year.The distribution of priceperlb is right-skewed, indicating that most of the observations have a lower price per pound, with a few higher values extending the distribution to the right. The highest frequency occurs at a price close to $1.0 per pound, where the count reaches around 100.
Over the years, as the year has progressed, both total production and yield per colony have shown a consistent increase. This trend likely reflects advancements in agricultural technologies, improved resource management, and possibly more favorable environmental conditions. These factors have contributed to greater efficiency and productivity in the agriculture sector, indicating overall growth and a positive trajectory for future agricultural outcomes.
